print('Hey it\'s me, harsh.!') #here in order to use single quote in between the string i have used an escape sequence character, i.e., a back slash followed by the character i wanted, i.e., single quote.

print('hi, my name is harsh.! \nLets code.!') #escape sequence to add a new line is '\n'

print('hi', 5, 6, 5+6) #print accepts multiple values

print('hi', 5, 6, 5+6, sep='-') #print accepts a parameter called sep, which is a separator with which we want multiple values tht we give to print function to be separated

print('hi', 5, 6, 5+6, sep='-', end='@harsh\n') #print also accepts another parameter called end, and it the character or string which will be appended to the printed value
